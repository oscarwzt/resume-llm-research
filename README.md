# resume-llm-research
This project was done in 2023. I used a bunch of jupyter notebooks to analyze different data. I apologize for the very unstructured code.
## Abstract
Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools that can interpret and generate human-like texts. This research project aims to explore the capabilities of contemporary language models, specifically Llama2 and ChatGPT, in the context of recruitment or resume processing. We fine-tuned the Llama2 13B model to perform resume parsing on a dataset created by ChatGPT, and manually created a baseline parsing result dataset to evaluate the resume parsing performance of the fine-tuned Llama2 model and ChatGPT with various metrics. Finally, we perform a comparative analysis of the models' results. Our results suggest that while ChatGPT performs better than Llama2 in most categories, the differences are small and their performances are both strong. We conclude that their resume parsing abilities are very similar.
